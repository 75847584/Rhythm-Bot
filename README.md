## Description

Simple little music bot to queue up and play youtube vids over discord voice channels, some experimental spotify stuff but nothing solid yet.

## Usage

Run main.js after you have configured and added your token for the bot to use.

There is a built in configurable channel manager to keep the post count of text channels low since this bot tends to say a lot.
